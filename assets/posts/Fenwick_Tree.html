<h1>Where's the tree in Fenwick tree?</h1>
<p style="margin-left:1.5em"><i>December 2019</i></p> 
<p>If you&#39;ve ever read about Fenwick trees, you&#39;ve probably wondered where the tree that they speak of was at. You&#39;ve probably also wondered what on earth would motivate someone to come up with those bitwise gimmicks that magically solves a difficult problem. The answer is rooted (no pun intended) at the indices of a typical full binary search tree.</p>
<p>So the problem is to process two kinds of queries fast on an array $a$ of size $n$ initialized to zeroes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Add some number $v$ to $a_p$.</li>
<li>Return the sum $a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_p$. </li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#39;s look at a solution that&#39;s kinda similar to a typical divide and conquer approach that segment trees follow. Consider the array $$a=[11,~7,~14,~15,~1,~12,~5,~3,~6,~13,~9,~2,~4,~10,~8]$$ of size $n=15$. We'll construct a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree" target="_blank">binary search tree</a> on its indices ${1,2,...,15}$.</p>
<p> <img src="bst0.png" alt="BST"></p>
<p>We keep at each vertex the sum of values at all indices <strong>in its left subtree and itself</strong>. For instance, the red region in the image shows the relevant indices for vertex $12$. The corresponding sums for array $a$ are written within brackets. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Value at vertex $7$ is simply $a_7=5$.</li>
<li>Value at vertex $12$ is $a_9+a_{10}+a_{11}+a_{12}=30$.</li>
<li>Value at vertex $8$ is $a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_8=68$.</li>
</ul>
<p>There you go! What you&#39;re looking at is a Fenwick tree built on the array $a$. Let&#39;s observe how we can perform updates and retrieve sums. </p>
<p>If we were to compute $a_1+\cdots+a_{11}$ then we&#39;d start at the vertex $11$ and climb up to the root collecting values of vertices that cover some of our desired range. These are exactly the vertices with indices not greater than $11$. </p>
<ul>
<li>Initially we&#39;re at vertex $11$ which is not bigger than $11$, so we collect the sum $9$ and climb up.</li>
<li>Now we&#39;re at vertex $10$ which is not bigger than $11$, so we collect the sum $a_9+a_{10}=19$ and climb up. </li>
<li>Now we&#39;re at vertex $12$ which actually is bigger than $11$, so we do nothing and climb up.</li>
<li>Now we&#39;re at the root $8$ which is not bigger than $11$, so we collect the sum $a_1+\cdots+a_8=68$ and finish with $9+19+68=96$, which is our desired answer.</li>
</ul>
<p>How about adding $69$ to $a_5$? We perform a similar climb from vertex $5$ adding $69$ to the vertices that cover $a_5$. These are exactly the vertices with indices at least $5$.</p>
<ul>
<li>Initially we&#39;re at vertex $5$, which definitely covers $a_5$. So we add $69$ to it and climb up.</li>
<li>Now we&#39;re at vertex $4$ which is smaller than $5$, so this vertex doesn&#39;t get affected. We do nothing and climb up.</li>
<li>Now we&#39;re at vertex $6$ which is bigger than $5$, so it covers $a_5$. We add $69$ to it and climb up.</li>
<li>Finally we&#39;re at the root $8$ which is bigger than $5$, so it covers $a_5$. We add $69$ to it and finish our tour.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly these operations take time proportional to the height of the tree. And since we&#39;ve constructed a full binary search tree, the height and thus the runtime, is $\mathcal{O}(\lg n)$. </p>
<p>It remains to look closely at the vertex indices of a full binary search tree to further optimize this process. We naturally look at the binary representations of the indices. </p>
<p><img src="bst.png" alt="BinRep"></p>
<p>Here&#39;s a cool observation (try proving it maybe): 

<blockquote><em>When we move from a child $u$ to its parent, the last 1 (from left) in the binary representation of $u$ moves one step to the left (and possibly merges with another 1 if there is already one).</em></blockquote>

Let&#39;s call this operation <em>a shift</em>. So a shift transforms a vertex to its parent. For instance, vertex $11$ (<code>1011</code>) has parent $10$ (<code>1010</code>), which in turn has parent $12$ (<code>1100</code>). Equipped with this, we can revisit our algorithms to retrieve sums and perform updates. </p>
<p>In order to compute $a_1+\cdots+a_{11}$ we need to collect sums at vertices on the way from vertex $11$ to root that have indices at most $11$. But notice that a shift decreases the original value if there&#39;s a merge happening, and increases the value otherwise. For example: <code>1010</code> transforms into <code>1100</code> after a shift which is bigger. But <code>1011</code> transforms into <code>1010</code> after a shift which is smaller - this is because the last 1 merges with the one on its left and thus, essentially vanishes. We can utilize this observation to <em>skip</em> all the shifts without merges and move to the next merge: <code>1101 -&gt; 1110 -&gt; 1100</code> simplifies into <code>1101 -&gt; 1100</code>. This is essentially <em>removing</em> the last 1 bit: <code>1101 - 0001 = 1100</code>. So our algorithm looks like this: start at vertex $11$, collect sum, remove last 1, repeat (till root). </p>
<p>In order to add $69$ to $a_5$ we need to update all vertices on the way from vertex $5$ to root that have indices at least $5$. We recall the observation that a shift decreases the original number if there&#39;s a merge happening, and increases otherwise. So we need to <em>skip</em> all the shifts with merges and move to the next shift without merge: <code>1011 -&gt; 1010 -&gt; 1100</code> simplifies into <code>1011 -&gt; 1100</code>. This is essentially <em>adding to</em> the last 1 bit: <code>1011 + 0001 = 1100</code>. So our algorithm looks like this: start at vertex $5$, add value, add to the last 1, repeat (till root).</p>
<p>And finally, let&#39;s look at a trick to isolate the last 1 bit in a number <code>x</code>: it is given by <code>x &amp; -x</code>. Here&#39;s why: let&#39;s write the number as <code>x = a10..0</code> where the <code>1</code> is the last one in <code>x</code>. Then <code>-x</code> is found by inverting all bits in <code>x</code> and adding <code>1</code> (two&#39;s complement). We get <code>-x = b01..1 + 1 = b10..0</code> where <code>b</code> is found by inverting all bits of <code>a</code>. So <code>x &amp; -x = (a10..0) &amp; (b10..0) = 0..010..0</code> with only the last <code>1</code> bit of <code>x</code> retained at its position. </p>
<p>Combining all this, we get the following procedures that take up $\mathcal{O}(n)$ memory in whole and $\mathcal{O}(\lg n)$ time per query.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
  void add (int p, int v) {
    while (p <= n) a[p] += v, p += p & -p;
  }

  int sum (int p) {
    int ret = 0;
    while (p) ret += a[p], p -= p & -p;
    return ret;
  }
</pre>
