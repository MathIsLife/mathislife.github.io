## About Me
Hi there! My name is Jubayer Nirjhor. I'm pursuing a Ph.D. in computer science at the University of Michigan. I'm fortunate to be mentored by <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~nswein/" target="_blank">Nicole Wein</a>. Previously, I completed my undergrad in computer science at the University of Dhaka. 

My current research interest lies in theoretical computer science, specifically dynamic algorithms. I look for ways to design and improve algorithms that cope with constantly changing data.

I enjoy solving mathematical and algorithmic puzzles from a very early age. I've had the privilege of going to the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) twice during high school (winning a medal), and to the world finals of the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) thrice during undergrad. My team has also been the champion in the ICPC Asia-West continent finals.
